Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.</p><pre><code> Three 1's =&gt; 1000 points Three 6's =&gt;  600 points Three 5's =&gt;  500 points Three 4's =&gt;  400 points Three 3's =&gt;  300 points Three 2's =&gt;  200 points One   1   =&gt;  100 points One   5   =&gt;   50 point</code></pre><p>Each of 5 dice can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a given "5" can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.</p><p>Example scoring</p><pre><code> Throw       Score ---------   ------------------ 5 1 3 4 1   250:  50 (for the 5) + 2 * 100 (for the 1s) 1 1 1 3 1   1100: 1000 (for three 1s) + 100 (for the other 1) 2 4 4 5 4   450:  400 (for three 4s) + 50 (for the 5)</code></pre><p>Note: your solution must not modify the input list.</p>
